# CL-Catmull-Rom-Spline

This is a Common Lisp library implementing Catmull-Rom splines as described by
this paper: http://algorithmist.net/docs/catmullrom.pdf

Splines provide a way to designate an ordered list of control points (knots) in
a 2D plane and find a "smooth" path that travels through or around the points.
CM splines have particularly nice properties for game applications:

* The path actually goes through each knot
* If you relocate a knot then only the path near the knot changes
* You can have a looping path by using the same knot as the start and end point
* Paths (usually) look nicely smooth enough despite not being CÂ²-continuous like
  cubic splines
* Cheap to calculate

# System Outline

`:cl-catmull-rom-spline` is the main library code. The typical usage is to
construct a new Spline object, add some knots, then repeatedly ask for the next
point along the spline path.

`:cl-catmull-rom-spline/test` contains a few unit tests.

`:cl-catmull-rom-spline/example` contains a small SDL1-backed graphical example
to show off adding knots and animating an object following the path. Simply
load the system and execute `(spline-example:launch)`.
Note that testing on an Ubuntu 16 system, even after apt-getting libsdl1.2-dev,
this system was raising an error on load trying to find libSDL\_gfx.
Continuing the load and launching still seemed to work anyway, though. But
it's also resolveable by apt-getting libsdl-gfx1.2-dev.
